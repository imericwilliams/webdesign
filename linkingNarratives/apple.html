        <h1><b>Trying to get Apple to make all of its iPhones or other products in the US is kind of a bad idea</b><h1><br>
        <p>Trump often complains about the <a href="apple2.html">US-China</a> trade deficit, which was $375 billion in 2017, and computers and electronics contribute a significant portion of that amount. The president has focused on manufacturing jobs in that context. But such a narrow purview, specifically with regard to Apple, misses some important points.
        </p>
        <p>Experts also argue that Trump’s narrow focus on manufacturing jobs ignores the other jobs — particularly white-collar roles — that Apple creates in the US.
