        <p><br>Even if President Donald Trump won his battle with Apple and the tech giant started to <a href="manufacture.html">manufacture</a> its iPhones in the United States, it might not even be a good idea.<br></p>

        <p><br>Trump lashed out at Apple recently after the company said the White House’s proposed $200 billion tariffs on Chinese goods would hurt its business. Trump <a href="tweet.html">tweeted</a>: “Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now.”</br></p>

        <p><br>It’s tempting to write off Trump here as just tweeting populist rhetoric, but he actually does hit on something interesting — should Apple be making more of the iPhone and other products in the US?</br></p>
