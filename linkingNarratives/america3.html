        <h2>Sweeteners needed<h2>
        <p>The government would probably need to provide generous sweeteners to make any of this happen.
        Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn has committed $10 billion to build a plant in Wisconsin. The state’s giving the company about $4 billion in incentives.</p>

        <p>“It takes a few years to get a display or chip factory up and running, so committing to a multi-billion-dollar investment for one of them requires a certainty that the products will have a local market when the factory starts running,” Linden said. “For that reason, it probably makes more sense to start assembling phones here first, then worry about the components later.”</p>

        <p>In 2013, Motorola announced that its Moto X would be “designed, engineered, and assembled” in the US — specifically, in Texas. The parts were still imported from <a href="china.html">China</a> and elsewhere, then put together in the US. The phones wound up costing a few percentage points more than they would have had assembly taken place in Asia, Linden said, and the Texas plant closed in 2014.</p>

        <p>Google dabbled in a similar idea with its media player, Nexus Q, but that didn’t work out either. “These were both experiments that ultimately came to the same conclusion that manufacturing in China is the most economically viable option,” Lam, from IHS, told me.
