        <p>iPhone exports look like a big loss to the US — by one estimate, imports of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus contributed $15.7 billion, or 4.4 percent, to the 2017 trade deficit with China — but the calculation is more complicated.</p><br>

        <p>China isn’t actually making that much money off of the iPhone, at least in comparison to the device’s total cost. Linden, along with Syracuse University information studies professor Jason Dedrick, and University of California-Irvine business research professor <a href="apple3.html">Kenneth Kraemer</a>, earlier this year estimated that China only makes $8.46 for each iPhone made.</p><br>

        <p>That’s a fraction of the $240 factory cost that’s recorded when it enters the US from China, or the amount the government “counts” as what’s being imported. In other words, the government tallies each iPhone brought in as $240 toward the deficit, instead of what researchers say should be less than $9.</p><br>

        <p>“This number does not reflect the reality of how much value China actually gets from its iPhone exports — or from many of the brand-name electronics goods it ships to the US or elsewhere,” the researchers wrote. “Thanks to the globe-spanning supply chains that run through China, trade deficits in the modern economy are not always what they seem.”</p><br>

        <p><a href="apple.html">Apple</a> has warned some of its products, but not the iPhone, will be affected if Trump imposes additional tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products. The company has said they would cause it to raise prices on products such as the Apple Watch and AirPods, its wireless headphones. The Trump administration has reportedly assured Cook that the iPhone won’t be affected by tariffs.</p>
