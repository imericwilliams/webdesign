        <h1>What does “Made in America” mean?<h1><br>
          <p>When we talk about “<a href="america2.html">Made in America</a>,” that can mean multiple things. It could mean assembling parts that are brought in from other places. Or it could mean making some of the parts and assembling them here. Or — the most difficult — sourcing every single component and material from the US.</p>

          <p>The simplest option for Apple to claim it “makes” iPhones in the <a href="america3.html">US</a> would be option one, bringing in the pieces and putting them together here.
