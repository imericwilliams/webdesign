        <li><b>Open Adobe Illustrator.</b></li></br>
        <li><b>Navigate and click on "Print" in the menu tab.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Select a Letter format to create the design.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Deselect the Selection tool and pick the Penicl tool instead.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>On the right of the screen, select the Properties tab and change the stroke color of the medium being used.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Green is the color of choice for this drawing, and make sure that the size is 1pt.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Begin by sketching an upside down "V" in the middle of the screen with the Penicl tool</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Next, draw from the bottom right edge of the upside down "V" diagonally up from where the tool is, and end the line right after the bottom left edge of the upside down "V."</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Do the same thing but starting from the bottom left edge, draw a line which crosses the previous line and stopping after the bottom right edge of the drawing.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Draw a horizontal line that connects the ends of those two new points.</b></li><br></br>
        <!--The quality of the drawing should be mediocre, so minimum effort is key! -->
        <li><b>If there are six geometric shapes, five being the same and one in the middle, then move on.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>If this is not the case Go back to Step #7.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Additionally, the bottom two shapes should be longer than the other three shapes on the upper half of the drawing.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>After the drawing is completed it, re-size it by making it larger if it was not done before.</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Other than that, you have completed the task correctly!</b></li><br></br>
        <li><b>Export the image and email to ewilli2@gmu.edu</b></li><br></br>
