         <p>A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments, and gray,
         steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods and
         others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the
         door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron
         spikes.</p>
