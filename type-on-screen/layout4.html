       <h2>NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</h2>
          <p>THE PRISON-DOOR</p><br>
          <p>A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments, and gray,
          steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods and
          others bareheaded, was assembled in front of a wooden edifice, the
          door of which was heavily timbered with oak, and studded with iron
          spikes.</p>
